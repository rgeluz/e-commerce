	//MySQL Database 
	Servername = 127.0.0.1
	Username = root
	Passowrd = testdb124
	Databasename = ecommerce

	Requirement #1: All of our Product Category Pages are generated by servlets with the suffix "ProdCat" and all our Product Detail Pages are generated by ProductDetails.java. In the ProductDetails.java, the HttpSession attribute "viewed" is a LinkedList used to store our last 5 products viewed by the user. Each time a user views a product page, this "viewed" attribute add's the id of the product viewed. This session attribute is then later retrieved in the Shopping Cart page generated by the servlet ShoppingCart.java.

	Requirement #2: As mentioned above in requirement #1 description, all product detail pages are generated by a single servlet ProductDetails.java. Each product details page is provided a product id and is assembled with the related product information retrieved from the ecommerce database's product table given the provided product id. In each product details page is an "Add to Cart" button, which when clicked, stores the item information such as product id and quantity into a HttpSession attribute "cart". This is a Map<String, Integer> that stores all of the products and their corresponding quantities as a collection. The shopping cart page is generated by the servlet ShoppingCart.java and retrieves the http session attribute "cart" to build out a table of the shopping cart items. The shopping cart also include a calculate order summary based on the items in the shopping cart.

	Requirement #3: After a user visit the shopping cart, they can click the "PROCEED TO CHECKOUT" button, this will take them to the checkout page. The checkout page is generated by the servlet Checkout.java. In here the shopping cart table and order summary is recreated using data from the http session attribute "cart". to the right of the order summary and shopping cart is the orderform. In here the user enters information such as shipping and billing and when they are ready they can click the "SUBMIT" button. When clicking the "SUBMIT" button, the Checkout.java servlet sends a post requst to the Order Processing servlet OrderProcessing.java. A post method is used to secure customer sensitive information such as credit card and address. In the order processing servlet, sub totals, shipping, taxes and final total is calculated. The  order informatin is then stored into the ecommerce databases' order table. The database.java class handles all databases calls, whether its data retrieveal or insertion. All sql statements use prepared statements to prevent sql injection. Upon completion of order processing and order record insertion, the order processing servlet, uses RequestDispatcher's forward method, to forward the http request to the Order Confirmation servlet OrderConfirmation.java. In the OrderConfirmation.java servlet, the order confirmation is generated and displayed the customer.  The page includes the date the order was made, a table of all the products purchased and their quanitites. It includes subtotals, discount, shipping, tax and final total information. It also provides a billing and shipping summary fo the customer.

	//MySQL Database 
	Servername = 127.0.0.1
	Username = root
	Passowrd = testdb
	Databasename = ecommerce


	Our website is a conversion of our previous website (See "About the site for PA-1" description below) from static pages to dynamically generated pages.
	The website is now hosted on Apache web server, to support PHP.
	To enable dynamic generation, we now use a MySQL database to store product information.
	The database is also used to store customer order information as well.
	Every webpage has now been converted from html to php (except the index.html, which is a static page).
	Since, all of the pages comprise of the same header and a footer, the header and footer are now dynamically created by thse same 
        header.php and footer.php files, eliminating the redundancy in PA-1. This way, if a change needs to be done on either the header 
	and footer, the code change only needs to be performed on a single file, and all the changes will cascade to all files using those php files.
	The product page, displays several product categories, each represented by a category card.
	When clicked, the user is directed to that product category's page. In here, the related products are displayed in the form of product cards.
	Since each product category page can contain a variable number of products, this page now dynamically generates the product cards,
	using the product records stored in the product table.
	All php files that use database calls, import the file database.php
	In database.php, all of the user defined database functions are centrally located.
	We use the PDO (PHP Data Objects) approach, as opposed to the MySQLi extension approach, in implementing the database calls.
	Every single sql statment, when executed, begins with a openning connection and closing connection, to ensure minimization of the number of uncessary connection threads.
	When the user selects a product card, displayed in the product category page, the user is directed to the product's details page.	
	All product details pages are dyamically generated from a single file named "productdetails.php"
	This page, takes a single product id, passed from the previous page via get method, and then queries the ecommerce database, retrieve the related product data, and is used to build the product details page according to the product id.
	Every product details page is accompanied with a product order form.
	When a customer fills out the order form and submits the form, upon submisson, first the onsumbit event handler calls the validate() function to perform client-side validation, which is located in productdetail.js, in here the javascript checks for empty fields, and peforms regular expressions matching to validate email format. In the previous version of the website (PA-1) after javascript validation, an email was created containing the product and order information. This is now been disabled in favor of a order confirmation page.
	After the validate() funcition is finished, the form is configured to send a post method to the ordervalidation.php file.
	The page is redirected to the ordervalidation.php and server-side validaton is performed on the individual form fields.
	The validate_input() funcition is called on all form fields, and validation involves the stripping of unnecessary characters, removal of backslashes, and escaping HTML code to prevent Cross-site Scripting (XSS).
	After validation, the order's subtotal, shipping, taxes and final total are calculated.
	The order information is then stored into the order table of the database, using the setOrder() function.
	The setOrder() database function, uses a prepared statement to prevent sql injection.
	For ajax, our website uses ajax in two different areas. We use ajax in our product search page and we use ajax in our product order form.
	For the product search page, when a user enters a keyword, in the search box, keykup event listener is triggered and a post method is sent to the getProducts.php file.
	Each time a key is pressed, the search page's content displays related products in table format. The products in the table provide a link to the their respective product detail pages.
	For the second ajax feature, when a user is data entering the order form, ajax is used to assist the user an entering information.
	When the user enters a character in the state field, auto complete capability is provided to suggest possible states to the user. 
	When the user enters a number in the zip code field, auto complete capability is provided to suggest possible zipcodes to the user, when a user selects a zip code, the city and state pertaining to that zip code, are auto populated in their respective fields.
	To implement this, the event listeners point to either getState.php or getZip.php. Inside of these files are database calls to the database.php file.
	We also implemented the state and zipcode table in the ecommerce database, to store the information needed for auto suggestion in the form fields.

//	About the site for PA-1
//-------------------------------//
	Our website, is an ecommerce site, that is an online retailer for all things video game related.
	We have a cool introducing home page where the user must click the floating bar to enter the actual e-commerce page.
	The products page shows the overview about our products, along with the general categories of merchandise that 
	we are selling.
	The top navigation bar also provide a about drop down button, where our team, company and contact pages are located.
	The company page gives the overview about the site, and team page gives relative information about the team
	and also the student ids. The contact page also shows a email option that could send contact request.
	From the product page the user can choose any category he or she is interested and upon clicking on the category picture,
	the customer enters the product category page, which display the related products. 
	The category and product cards have hover effect which zooms out when a mouse is being hovered on.
	The customer can click on the individual product's picture, to enter the product's details page.
	The detailed page shows all basic information about the product, the user can click on the small pictures to 
	enlarge them.
	The ordering form can also be found on each of the product detail pages, upon submission, it checks each field and peforms 	
	validation. After validation an email is sent confirming the purchase order.
